### Responsive Images the Simple Way

_Cloud Four, 2023_ • [Article](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-the-simple-way/)

The responsive images spec covers a lot of use cases, but most of the time you’ll only need one: Serving a different sized copy of the same image depending on the user’s viewport width. We call this resolution switching, and you can accomplish it using the srcset and sizes attributes. In this video, Scott will guide you through the simple way to make your images responsive by providing a list of image assets for the browser to choose from.

### What is Modular CSS?

_Devsigner 2016_ • [Slides](https://noti.st/spaceninja/sIdZ2I/what-is-modular-css)

Modular CSS is a concept that will help you write more maintainable and readable code. It is compatible with any and all CSS preprocessors and naming conventions. You may have heard of BEM, SMACSS, or OOCSS, which are methodologies that all share the key concepts of modular CSS.

Modular CSS means you avoid ever writing special snowflake CSS that's only used in one spot. It helps you standardize your code and look for patterns. It helps you dry up your code and ensure that each class has a clearly defined responsibility, and help you avoid overlap and conflicts between classes.

Essentially, if you're ever going to write CSS at scale, you owe it to yourself to understand what modular CSS is, and how it can dramatically improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

### Flexbox Will Shock You!

_Devsigner 2015_

Flexbox is a smart new layout mode for CSS that solves many problems we've struggled with for years. It adds a degree of control we didn't have before. No longer will you need to struggle with floats and clearfixes to address page layout challenges they were never designed to handle.

But wait, I hear you say, a new layout mode? Surely the browser support is awful? It's actually quite good, and I will show you how to write future-proof code that will work flawlessly in browsers that support flexbox while providing a fallback to those that don't.

In this talk, I will introduce the flexbox layout module and explain what it's good for (and what's it's NOT good for). I'll give examples of usage, outline a strategy for browser support, and prepare you to use flexbox TODAY!

This is a beginner level talk. You do not need to know anything about flexbox, but a basic understanding of CSS layout will be helpful.

### Tips for Front-End Teams without Tears, Heartache, or Fistfights

_WebVisions Portland 2012_

You know the right way to do things. You've got strong opinions on source order, indenting, and comment styles. What happens when your wolf pack of one has to expand, and you add things like version control to the mix? I'll teach you how to work on a team without resorting to swearing or eye-gouging.

You and your teammates may not be best friends, but you can stop fighting about tabs versus spaces and get back to what matters: Who put Lady Gaga on the office stereo?
