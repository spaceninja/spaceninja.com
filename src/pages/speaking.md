### What is Modular CSS?

_Devsigner 2016_

Modular CSS is a concept that will help you write more maintainable and readable code. It is compatible with any and all CSS preprocessors and naming conventions. You may have heard of BEM, SMACSS, or OOCSS, which are methodologies that all share the key concepts of modular CSS.

Modular CSS means you avoid ever writing special snowflake CSS that's only used in one spot. It helps you standardize your code and look for patterns. It helps you dry up your code and ensure that each class has a clearly defined responsibility, and help you avoid overlap and conflicts between classes.

Essentially, if you're ever going to write CSS at scale, you owe it to yourself to understand what modular CSS is, and how it can dramatically improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

This talk is aimed at intermediate level front-end developers. We won't be covering any advanced CSS, so as long as you know the basics, you should be able to follow along just fine.

You will learn:

1. The unlying patterns of all modular CSS methodologies
2. How to write CSS that scales
3. How to write CSS that is easy to understand and maintain
4. How to write CSS that doesn't rely on context

### Lightning Talk: Responsive Images

_Internal Presentation at Say Media, 2017_

Let's talk about the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes, a progressive enhancement technique that allows the browser to choose the best image for the user's device. We'll also talk about the new `picture` element, and how it can be used for more advanced use cases like art direction or supporting new image formats.

### Flexbox Will Shock You!

_Devsigner 2015_

Flexbox is a smart new layout mode for CSS that solves many problems we've struggled with for years. It adds a degree of control we didn't have before. No longer will you need to struggle with floats and clearfixes to address page layout challenges they were never designed to handle.

But wait, I hear you say, a new layout mode? Surely the browser support is awful? It's actually quite good, and I will show you how to write future-proof code that will work flawlessly in browsers that support flexbox while providing a fallback to those that don't.

In this talk, I will introduce the flexbox layout module and explain what it's good for (and what's it's NOT good for). I'll give examples of usage, outline a strategy for browser support, and prepare you to use flexbox TODAY!

This is a beginner level talk. You do not need to know anything about flexbox, but a basic understanding of CSS layout will be helpful.

### Tips for Front-End Teams without Tears, Heartache, or Fistfights

_WebVisions Portland 2012_

You know the right way to do things. You've got strong opinions on source order, indenting, and comment styles. What happens when your wolf pack of one has to expand, and you add things like version control to the mix? I'll teach you how to work on a team without resorting to swearing or eye-gouging.

You and your teammates may not be best friends, but you can stop fighting about tabs versus spaces and get back to what matters: Who put Lady Gaga on the office stereo?

### Introduction to HTML5

_WebVisions Portland 2011, DrupalCamp LA 2010_

HTML5 is ready to use today, and Scott Vandehey can show you how to use it in your site. During this session, you will learn the answer to these questions:

- What is HTML5?
- What features does it offer me?
- How do I set up my themes to use it?
- How well supported is it?

By the end, you will see that converting your site to HTML5 can offer you real benefits, and will position you to easily take advantage of new features as they become available. With its focus on graceful degradation, there’s no reason to delay. Learn how HTML5 can help you!

This session is intended for beginner to intermediate level front-end developers and designers. You should have a healthy interest in markup.

We will be introducing some of the new elements, such as Article, Section, and Video, but not the new APIs like drag-and-drop or geolocation.
