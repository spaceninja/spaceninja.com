## 9: [The `hanging-punctuation` property in CSS](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/11/27/the-hanging-punctuation-property-in-css/)

> The `hanging-punctuation` property in CSS is almost a no-brainer. The classic example is a blockquote that starts with a curly-quote. Hanging that opening curly-quote into the space off to the start of the text and aligning the actual words is a better look.

## 8: [Complex MPA View Transitions](https://tylergaw.com/blog/complex-mpa-view-transitions/)

> Full page transitions are OK, but they also make a site feel like a PowerPoint. The only time I’m likely to use full page transitions is if I’m making a web-based slide deck. Even then, using only full page animations can feel flat. Animating multiple elements in an orchestrated way is a better way to use motion to create interesting effects. So, that’s what I’ve done. Let’s get into it.

## 7: [It’s 2023, here is why your web design sucks.](https://heather-buchel.com/blog/2023/10/why-your-web-design-sucks/)

> Exploring the reasons why we no longer have web designers. TLDR: At some point, we told design they couldn't sit with us anymore, and surprise! It backfired! Now, not only has the field and profession of web design suffered, but also, we build shitty websites.

## 6: [HTML Web Components](https://adactio.com/journal/20618)

> When you wrap some existing markup in a custom element and then apply some new behaviour with JavaScript, technically you’re not doing anything you couldn’t have done before with some DOM traversal and event handling. But it’s less fragile to do it with a web component. It’s portable. It obeys the single responsibility principle. It only does one thing but it does it well.

## 4: [HTML Web Components Are Having a Moment](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/html-web-components-are-having-a-moment/)

> Eric’s post showed me that web components could be simpler than I thought. Jeremy came up with a brilliantly approachable name with “HTML web components.” And everyone else who wrote about them in the following weeks added to the growing sense that, yes, this was a thing that I could do, that had clear value, and I began looking for opportunities to use them.

## 2: [Solved With :has(): Vertical Spacing in Long-Form Text](https://css-tricks.com/solved-with-has-vertical-spacing-in-long-form-text/)

> To recap the improvements this aims to make: No wrapper class is required; We’re working with a consistent margin direction; Collapsing margins are avoided (which may or may not be an improvement, depending on your stance); There’s no setting styles and then immediately overriding them;

> Today I wanna talk about a CSS feature that doesn't get too much attention… but it should! The `isolation` property basically provides more control over how elements interact with the rest of the document, and it is often an elegant solution for `z-index` issues.

## [Using CSS custom properties like this is a waste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2LwjfYc1x8)

> Custom properties are amazing, but a lot of people don’t take advantage of how awesome they are. They set them up in the `:root` and that’s it, but they can be so much more useful than that! So, in this video I explore how we take them up a notch and make our code a lot more efficient in the process.
