[In 2022 I read 35 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/33750365), but I struggled to put this list together, because I didn’t _love_ very many of them. A lot of my list was books I was reading to John during bedtime (The Hitchhiker’s Guide books, and the Discworld books), as well as several UFO-related books in preparation for [my podcast](https://veryexcitingtime.com). But looking back over the list, there were two that stood out.

## [_Nona the Ninth_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59830943-nona-the-ninth), by Tamsyn Muir

> She looked up at the sky, and she bellowed: “You said you wouldn’t do anything weird!”

This is an odd book to review. If you enjoyed _Gideon the Ninth_ or _Harrow the Ninth_, the first two books in the Locked Tomb series, then you don’t need me to convince you to read. If you haven’t read them yet, then a review of the third book in a series isn’t going to convince you.

It’s also odd because it originally wasn’t intended as a separate book. The Nona material was originally part of the next book in the series, but, editor Carl Engle-Laird says: “Nona arrived, bursting forth from _Alecto the Ninth_ with an irrepressible energy and presence. She could not be contained, and demanded her own volume.”

While avoiding spoilers, I can tell you that this book starts out feeling very different from the previous two, but has the same sense of playfulness and humor. It’s set in a city in a war zone and told from the perspective of Nona, a girl with a strange past and a broken memory. She lives with Pyrrha, Camilla, and Palamedes, and has a list of dogs she would like to invite to her birthday party. And if that doesn’t convince you to read, I don’t know what will.

> **Dogs to invite to birthday party**
>
> - Brown one by the fish shop, average sized, four legs
> - Stop It, name assumed, lies under counter at dairy, red colour, big sized, four legs
> - White-and-black one seen once in the park, average sized, tail curled twice, three legs
> - Noodle, king of dogs in secret, white-adjacent, small sized, six legs
> - Spotted beach dog, often on beach, large sized, huge ginger eyebrows, three legs

## [_Surviving Death: A Journalist Investigates Evidence for an Afterlife_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32613374-surviving-death), by Leslie Kean

I loved Kean’s first book, _UFOs: Generals, Pilots, And Government Officials Go On The Record_, but I was slow to pick up her second. To be honest, I didn’t until I watched the Netflix series _Surviving Death_, which is based on her book. I was hoping for more detail beyond what the show covered, and the book does deliver that. I appreciated that Kean used the same format as _UFOs_, with her commentary sections interspersed with sections written by researchers explaining how they approach such a difficult-to-study topic.

The reincarnation sections plug nicely into another book I greatly enjoyed on the topic, _Journey of Souls_, by Michael Newton. Kean shares some extraordinary stories, including a young boy with recurring nightmares of being trapped in the cockpit of a burning plane as it crashed, and how the details he remembered led the family to find a particular WWII pilot whose life matches uncannily well.

The mediumship sections are presented well, and Kean is well aware that there’s a less compelling story to tell, with a “you had to be there” kind of vibe. I didn’t mind it, but I wasn’t compelled by it either.

Overall, if you’re interested in a good high-level overview of what information we have about life after death, I recommend it. That said, all the best bits were covered in the Netflix series, so feel free to watch that if you’re not sure about the book.
