I'm in love with these lists of "Falsehoods Programmers Believe About _X_." In case you haven't had pleasure, I've collected all the ones I know of here. If I missed any, let me know!

#### [Falsehoods programmers believe about names](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/)

- People's names do not change
- People’s names have an order to them
- My system will never have to deal with names from China
- I can safely assume that this dictionary of bad words contains no people’s names in it
- People have names

#### [Falsehoods programmers believe about time](http://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time)

- The time zone in which a program has to run will never change
- The system clock will never be set to a time that is in the distant past or the far future
- One minute on the system clock has exactly the same duration as one minute on any other clock
- A time stamp of sufficient precision can safely be considered unique
- The duration of one minute on the system clock would never be more than an hour

#### [More falsehoods programmers believe about time](http://infiniteundo.com/post/25509354022/more-falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time)

- The local time offset (from UTC) will not change during office hours.
- My software is only used internally/locally, so I don’t have to worry about timezones
- I can easily maintain a timezone list myself
- Time passes at the same speed on top of a mountain and at the bottom of a valley

#### [Falsehoods programmers believe about time zones](http://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/01/28/falsehoods-programmers-date-time-zones.html)

- Every day without DST changes is 86400 (`60 * 60 _ 24`) seconds long
- If you have two UTC timestamps it is possible to calculate how many seconds will be between them even if one of the timestamps are a year into the future
- The time `23:59:60` is always invalid

- Place names can be written with the exhaustive character set of a country
- Places have only one official address
- Street addresses contain street names

#### [Falsehoods programmers believe about addresses](https://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/)

- No buildings are numbered zero
- A road will have a name
- A single postcode will be larger than a single building
- OK, but you don't get multiple postcodes per building
- Addresses will have a reasonable number of characters — less than 100, say
