### AKA: Pandemic Television

A friend of mine recently asked on Slack: "What's good on Netflix right now? What are y'all watching?"

After answering I realized that I watch a _lot_ of television, and I thought I'd share our replies for anyone else looking for recommendations.

- _The Witcher_ is very good if you like some stoic grim fantasy.
- BBC’s _Dracula_ is by the creative team behind _Sherlock_. I can’t say anything without spoilers, but if you dig _Sherlock_, you’ll probably like _Dracula_ too.
- _Bojack Horseman_ is one of those shows that brilliantly threads the line between deeply depressing and sometimes hilarious. The final season just got added.
- _Tuca & Bertie_ is another animated show by the creator of _Bojack_, about two bird women trying to figure out their lives, starring Ali Wong and Tiffany Haddish.
- _Derry Girls_ is so goddamn funny I’m mad I didn’t start the list with it. It’s about teenage girls in Troubles-era Ireland.
- _Samurai Gourmet_ is one of my favorite shows of all time, about a retired Japanese salaryman who doesn’t know what to do with his time. It’s like a love letter to lunch.
- _Altered Carbon_ is excellent science fiction. Season two just aired and is even better than the first.
- _The Umbrella Academy_ is deeply weird science-fiction-y super-hero-y series, based on a comic book by the lead singer of My Chemical Romance.
- _Grand Designs_ is a lovely British show that brings the same relaxing energy of _Great British Bake-Off_, but brings it to a show about people building their own homes. Strongly recommended for when you’re up late and need something calming.
- _Russian Doll_ is basically _Groundhog Day_ with Natasha Lyonne, and if that hasn’t already sold you I’m not sure what else to say.
- _Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance_ is a new series made by the Henson creature shop, set in the same world as the movie. I haven’t watched it yet, but I’ve heard if you dug the movie, you’ll like this.
- If you have Amazon Prime, you absolutely must watch _Fleabag_, it is incredible.
- If you have Disney Plus, _the Madalorian_ is the best Star Wars content made in decades. The elevator pitch is “What if we made _Lone Wolf and Cub_ with Boba Fett?”
- I dunno where you can stream it, but _Wynonna Earp_ is delicious trash. Annie and I eat it up. Very _True Blood_ vibes. Wynonna is the descendant of Wyatt Earp, and must hunt demons with a ferociously gay crew of characters.
- Similarly, _the Magicians_ is a lot of fun. They take themselves a bit too seriously at times, but the show is worth watching for Margo alone.
- And, of course, if you haven’t watched _the Good Place_, pump that to the top of your queue.

Jenn chimed in with a few recommendations:

- _Merlin_, which is about young Merlin meeting up with young Prince Arthur and shenanigans ensue.
- _Locke and Key_ (another show based on a comic) about kids in a sort of haunted house, has also been fun.

Steve endorsed the Spanish TV show *Money Heist, *which is on Netflix. (Please watch the subtitled version; the dubbing is dreadful.) Miniseries-length bank robbery/hostage drama about a group of robbers taking over the Royal Mint in Madrid. My friend Ben correctly identified the mastermind (El Profesore!) as Batman. Like, plans within plans, and then a bunch of frenetic genius improvisation when the backup plans go wrong.

Then someone asked about anime recommendations.

- I said _Gurren Lagan_ and _Kill la Kill_ are bonkers, and _My Hero Academia_ is very good.
- Jenn suggested _FLCL_, _Soul Eater_, _Samurai Champloo_, _Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood_, both _Sword Art Onlines_, _Gurren Lagan_, _Death Note_, _Noragami_, and _Ouran High School Host Club_.
- Steve mentioned his 10-year-old is a big fan of both _Full Metal Alchemist_ and _Yuri On Ice_. And also that he enjoys _One Punch Man_.

Jarrod chimed in with a few recommendations:

- _Hunter x Hunter_ is a pretty great anime. Like 13+ age range, but a good coming-of-age story about a boy searching for his father. A couple of legitimately scary characters, but mostly very positive theme.
- _Cowboy Bebop_ for serious 90s anime vibe.
- _Sword Art Online_ seemed so incredibly lame when someone first pitched it to me, but when I finally watched it I was blown away.

And then Vicki came in with a big list:

- Horror Anime: _Another_ (12 episodes), _When Cicada’s Cry_ (26 episodes for set-up, 24 episodes for explanation)
- Magical Schoolgirl subversion: _Puella Magi Madoka Magicka_ (12 episodes)
- Sci-fi: _Steins;Gate_ (24? episodes)
- Fantasy Adventure with Historical references: _Fate/Stay Night_ (26 episodes) + _Fate/Zero_ (25 episodes), don’t remember which order you’re supposed to watch them in
- Would last through the year: No one going to mention _Naruto_, _Bleach_ or _One Piece_? (No comment on quality, only length)
- Obligatory: _Ghost in the Shell_ + movies, they also have a prequel now but haven’t seen it?
