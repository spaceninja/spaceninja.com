Once a year, I like to look back over my reading history and write a brief recommendation of my favorites. Partly I do this for anyone who might trust my judgement on what to read, but mostly it's because I have a terrible memory. I have books on my shelves that I remember reading and loving, and perhaps a bit about the story, but I couldn't tell you the major plot arc, or why anyone else should read it.

So, in 2019 I read [25 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/15025289). These were my favorites:

## _Star Wars: Thrawn_, by Timothy Zahn

A long time ago (the 90s), Timothy Zahn wrote a trilogy of books that were intended to be the closest we ever got to _Star Wars_ episodes 7-9. They’ve since been relegated to non-canonical “Legends” status, but they introduced many new characters and concepts to the _Star Wars_ universe, including the idea that Leia and Han had Force-sensitive children who attended a Jedi academy run by Luke.

Most notably, the books introduced a new villain, Grand Admiral Thrawn, who was restored to canon status when he appeared in the animated series _Rebels._ I was thrilled when Zahn returned to write a novel explaining Thrawn’s backstory in the new _Star Wars_ canon.

This book is everything I ever wanted. It explains how blue-skinned Thrawn came to power in the notably xenophobic Empire. It explains why he would want to do so, and the struggles he overcame by outwitting everyone who stood in his way.

## _The Collapsing Empire_, by John Scalzi

I read this on the strength of a review from Warren Ellis:

> “If you’re missing _Game Of Thrones_ or _The Expanse_, this is both. Also, if you ever liked the _Mission Impossible_ or _Leverage_ tv series, you will fucking love this. It’s court intrigue, spaceships, and a lovely long con.”

I don’t think I can really add anything to that, so I’ll just say that he’s right, I did fucking love it, and I can’t wait to read the next two books in the series.

## _The Tea Master and the Detective_, by Aliette de Bodard

This is a reimagining of Sherlock Holmes, where Sherlock is an abrasive drug-addicted scholar and Holmes is a starship with PTSD who retired from active duty to sell medicinal teas. The scholar hires the ship to brew her a special tea so she can still think while she investigates a murder in hyperspace.

It’s from the author’s Xuya series, an alternate history exploring what would happen if China discovered the Americas before Europe. But aside from sharing the setting, this novella is stand-alone. I loved it, and if you enjoy new spins on Sherlock Holmes, you’ll dig it too.

## The _Planetfall_ series, by Emma Newman

I devoured all four books in a row, so I’m having trouble not thinking of it as a single story. In a nutshell, they cover the aftermath of a particular incident from four wildly different perspectives: First, a woman grieving the loss of her best friend while trying to keep a secret from the colony they established on a new planet. Second, an indentured detective investigating the murder of a charismatic cult leader. Third, a geologist struggling with the needs of her family back on Earth as she takes a job on Mars. And the fourth I won’t mention because it’s a spoiler.

I found the series when io9 posted an excerpt ([the whole first chapter](https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-space-traveler-uncovers-an-impossible-mystery-in-the-1823250042), actually) from the third book:

> A geologist whose art has captured the imagination of a space-obsessed multibillionaire accepts a new a gig on Mars, partially as a way to escape the postpartum depression that’s been plaguing her back on Earth. But as soon as she arrives, she makes a shocking discovery—and suddenly she’s surrounded by strangers she can’t trust in a space colony that’s millions and millions of miles away from home.

I can’t recommend this series strongly enough. Go read that chapter and if you dig the vibe, you’re going to have a very good time reading these books.

## _The Expanse_, books 4 & 5, by James S.A. Corey

As I write this, the fourth season of _the Expanse_ show just aired, covering the events of _Cibola Burn_, the fourth book in the series. The authors have said that there are going to be nine books in the series, which can be loosely considered a trilogy of trilogies. So (with no spoilers), there was a major event that happened at the end of book/season 3 that changed the power balance of the solar system in dramatic ways.

That meant the next book was a bit of a slow burn. It takes time to explain a new dynamic. Things have changed, and the crew of the _Rocinante_ are right in the middle. It was all good stuff, but my attention started to wander because it felt a bit predictable.

But… BUT! At almost the exact midpoint of the book something absolutely insane happened, and the book was a freaking rollercoaster from that point on.

(The show covers the same events at roughly the same pace.)

I can’t say anything about _Nemesis Games_, the fifth book, without spoiling it, but suffice to say they take the stakes from _Cibola Burn_ and dial them up to 11.

If you’re not already reading/watching _the Expanse_, you really should start. It’s hands-down the best modern science fiction happening right now.
